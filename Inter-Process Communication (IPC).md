IPC stands for Inter-Process Communication. It is a set of mechanisms that allows [[process]]es to communicate with each other and share data, resources, and synchronization information. IPC is essential for building complex systems and applications that require multiple [[process]]es to work together.

There are various IPC mechanisms available in modern operating systems, including:

1.  Pipes: A unidirectional communication channel between two [[process]]es that allows one [[process]] to send data to another process.
    
2.  Message Queues: A message-based communication mechanism that allows [[process]]es to send and receive messages.
    
3.  Shared Memory: A memory region that is shared between multiple [[process]]es and can be used to share data between them.
    
4.  Semaphores: A synchronization mechanism that allows [[process]]es to coordinate their activities and prevent conflicts.
    
5.  Sockets: A network communication mechanism that allows [[process]]es on different machines to communicate with each other over a network.
    

IPC is an important part of modern operating systems and is widely used in many applications, including databases, web servers, and real-time systems. By providing a way for [[process]]es to communicate and share resources, IPC allows developers to build complex systems that are scalable, efficient, and reliable.
