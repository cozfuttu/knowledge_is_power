Bytecode is a low-level, machine-independent representation of a program that can be executed by a [[Virtual Machine]]. Bytecode is generated by compiling source code in high-level programming languages such as Java, Python, and Ruby.

Bytecode is typically a sequence of instructions that are similar to [[Assembly]] language instructions, but they are designed to be executed by a [[Virtual Machine]] instead of a physical CPU. The VM is responsible for interpreting the bytecode and executing the corresponding instructions.

One of the main advantages of using bytecode is that it allows the same program to run on different hardware and operating systems, as long as the [[Virtual Machine]] is available for each platform. This makes it easier to develop and distribute cross-platform applications.

Examples of bytecode include Java bytecode, which is generated by the Java [[Compiler]] and executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and Python bytecode, which is generated by the Python [[Interpreter]] and executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).
