[[Process]]es and [[thread]]s are both concepts related to concurrent and parallel execution in computing systems, but they have some key differences:

1.  Memory space:    
    -   Process: A process has its own separate memory space, which includes the code, global variables, heap, and stack. Each process runs independently of others, and the operating system manages memory protection to prevent one process from accessing another process's memory space without proper authorization.
    -   Thread: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, including code, global variables, and heap. Each thread has its own stack, program counter, and registers. Sharing memory allows threads to communicate and share data more efficiently but requires careful synchronization to prevent concurrency-related issues.
    
2.  Creation and management overhead:
    -   Process: Creating and managing processes involves more overhead compared to threads, as each process requires its own memory space, and [[inter-process communication (IPC)]] mechanisms are generally slower than intra-process communication between threads.
    -   Thread: Threads are considered lightweight because they share the same memory space as their parent process and have lower creation and management overhead compared to processes.
    
3.  Isolation and fault tolerance:
    -   Process: Processes are isolated from one another, meaning that if one process crashes or encounters an error, it does not directly affect other processes running on the system.
    -   Thread: Since threads share the same memory space, if one thread crashes or encounters an error, it can potentially corrupt shared data or cause the entire process to crash, affecting all other threads within that process.
    
4.  Communication:
    -   Process: [[Inter-Process Communication (IPC)|IPC]] typically involves using operating system-provided mechanisms, such as pipes, message queues, shared memory, or sockets. These methods are generally slower and more complex to use compared to intra-process communication between threads.
    -   Thread: Threads can communicate and share data more easily and efficiently since they share the same memory space. However, proper synchronization mechanisms, like mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables, must be used to prevent race conditions and other concurrency-related issues.

In summary, [[process]]es are independent units of execution with their own memory space, while [[thread]]s are lightweight units of execution within a process that share the same memory space. Processes provide isolation and fault tolerance at the cost of higher overhead, while threads enable efficient communication and sharing of data with lower overhead but require careful synchronization.
