A system interrupt vector is a data structure that maps [[interrupt]] numbers to interrupt handler routines in an operating system.

When an [[interrupt]] occurs, the system interrupt vector is consulted to determine the address of the interrupt handler routine that should be invoked to handle the [[interrupt]]. The interrupt handler routine is a function in the operating system that is designed to handle the specific [[interrupt]], and it typically saves the state of the interrupted [[process]], performs the required processing, and then restores the saved state so that the [[process]] can resume execution.

The system interrupt vector is typically initialized during system boot-up or during the installation of device drivers or system software. It is a table of function pointers that maps [[interrupt]] numbers to the corresponding interrupt handler routines in the operating system. Each entry in the table corresponds to a specific [[interrupt]] number, and the entry contains the address of the corresponding interrupt handler routine.

The system interrupt vector is an important mechanism for managing interrupts in an operating system, and it allows the operating system to provide efficient and responsive handling of system [[interrupt]]s. By mapping [[interrupt]] numbers to specific interrupt handler routines, the operating system can quickly and efficiently process [[interrupt]]s without the need for complex and time-consuming lookup operations.

In summary, the system interrupt vector is a data structure that maps [[interrupt]] numbers to interrupt handler routines in an operating system. It plays an important role in managing system interrupts and allows the operating system to provide efficient and responsive handling of hardware and software events.
