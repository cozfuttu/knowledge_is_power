### Key Functions of an Operating System

1. **Hardware Management**:
    
    - **Resource Allocation**: Allocates resources like [[Central Processing Unit (CPU)|CPU]], memory, and I/O devices to different programs.
    - **Device Drivers**: Facilitates communication between the hardware and software.
2. **Process Management**:
    
    - Manages the execution of [[process|processes]], including multitasking, process scheduling, and termination.
    - Ensures that processes don’t interfere with each other.
3. **Memory Management**:
    
    - Manages the allocation and deallocation of memory.
    - Provides virtual memory to extend physical memory.
4. **File System Management**:
    
    - Organizes, stores, retrieves, and manipulates data on storage devices.
    - Manages permissions, directories, and file access.
5. **User Interface**:
    
    - Provides a user interface, such as a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), for interaction with the system.
6. **Security and Access Control**:
    
    - Protects the system from unauthorized access and malware.
    - Manages user authentication and permissions.
7. **Networking**:
    
    - Enables communication between devices and systems through network protocols.
8. **Error Handling**:
    
    - Detects and responds to errors in hardware, software, or processes.

### Types of Operating Systems

1. **Batch Operating Systems**:
    
    - Executes batches of jobs without user interaction during execution.
    - Example: Early mainframe systems.
2. **Time-Sharing (or Multitasking) OS**:
    
    - Allows multiple users or programs to run simultaneously by allocating a time slice for each task.
    - Example: Unix, Windows.
3. **Distributed OS**:
    
    - Manages a group of independent computers as a single system.
    - Example: Google’s distributed systems, Hadoop.
4. **Real-Time OS (RTOS)**:
    
    - Provides immediate processing for time-critical tasks.
    - Example: FreeRTOS, QNX, VxWorks.
5. **Embedded OS**:
    
    - Optimized for specific hardware and applications.
    - Example: The OS in a microwave or smart thermostat.
6. **Mobile OS**:
    
    - Designed for smartphones and tablets.
    - Example: Android, iOS.
7. **Network OS**:
    
    - Facilitates network-based communication and resource sharing.
    - Example: Cisco IOS, Windows Server.

### Core Components of an Operating System

1. **[[Kernel]]**:
    - The core of the OS, responsible for low-level hardware interactions and resource management.
2. **Shell**:
    - The interface that allows users to interact with the OS (e.g., command-line or graphical shell).
3. **[[File System (FS)|File System]]**:
    - Manages files and directories.
4. **Device Drivers**:
    - Facilitates communication between the OS and hardware peripherals.
