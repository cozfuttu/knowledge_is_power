A translator is a type of software that converts code written in one programming language into another form. This is crucial because computers can only execute instructions in a very specific, low-level machine language, and most human programmers write code in higher-level, more abstract languages that are easier to understand and use.

There are three main types of translators:

1. **[[Compiler|Compilers]]**: A compiler translates the entire source code of a program in a high-level language into machine code (binary code) before the program is run. This machine code is usually stored in an executable file. When you run the executable, the computer can directly execute the machine code. Examples include the C++ compiler (e.g., GCC for C++) and the Java compiler (javac).
    
2. **[[Interpreter|Interpreters]]**: An interpreter translates high-level programming languages into machine code on the fly, while the program is running. It reads the source code, usually line by line, and executes each command as it goes. This means that the program does not need to be compiled before it is run. Python and Ruby are common examples of languages that are often interpreted.
    
3. **[[Assembler|Assemblers]]**: An assembler translates assembly language, a low-level programming language that is a bit more readable than raw machine code, into actual machine code that can be executed by a computer's CPU. Assembly language is specific to a given type of processor and is used for performance-critical or hardware-specific tasks.
    

Each type of translator has its own use cases and trade-offs in terms of speed of execution, ease of debugging, and flexibility in programming.
