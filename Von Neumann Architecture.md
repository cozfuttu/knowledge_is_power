The Von Neumann Architecture, also known as the Von Neumann model or the Princeton Architecture, is a foundational [[computer architecture]] that was first described by the mathematician and computer scientist John von Neumann in 1945. This architecture is based on the stored-program concept, which states that both program instructions and data are stored together in the same memory, allowing the computer to access and manipulate both instructions and data using the same set of circuits.

The Von Neumann Architecture consists of four main components:

1.  Memory: The memory stores both the program instructions and data. The memory is typically composed of an addressable, linear array of storage cells, where each cell can hold a fixed-size unit of data, such as a byte or word.
    
2.  Central Processing Unit (CPU): The CPU is responsible for executing the instructions stored in memory. It consists of two primary components: the [[Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)]], which performs arithmetic and logic operations, and the Control Unit (CU), which manages the flow of data and instructions between the CPU, memory, and other components.
    
3.  Input/Output (I/O) Devices: These devices enable communication between the computer and external devices or systems, such as keyboards, mice, displays, storage devices, or network interfaces.
    
4.  Buses: Buses are communication pathways that connect the various components of the computer system, allowing data and control signals to be transmitted between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
    

The Von Neumann Architecture follows a sequential [[fetch-execute cycle]], where the CPU fetches an instruction from memory, decodes it, executes the operation, and stores the result. This cycle is repeated for each instruction in the program until the program is completed or an interrupt occurs.

While the Von Neumann Architecture has been the basis for most computer systems for several decades, it also has inherent limitations, such as the "Von Neumann bottleneck." This bottleneck arises because the architecture uses a single bus to access both instructions and data in memory, which can limit the overall performance of the system. To address this limitation, modern computer architectures have introduced various techniques and optimizations, such as pipelining, parallelism, and caching, to improve performance and efficiency.
