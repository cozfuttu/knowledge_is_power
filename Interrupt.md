An interrupt is a signal that notifies the operating system or a program that an event or condition has occurred and requires immediate attention. Interrupts can be generated by hardware devices such as keyboards, mice, or disk drives, or by software programs such as device drivers or [[system call]]s.

When an interrupt occurs, the normal execution of the program or operating system is temporarily suspended, and control is transferred to a special interrupt handler routine that is designed to handle the specific interrupt. The interrupt handler typically saves the current state of the program, processes the interrupt, and then restores the saved state so that the program can resume execution from where it left off.

Interrupts are an important mechanism for managing system resources and providing responsive and efficient operation of the computer system. By allowing hardware devices to generate interrupts when they require attention, the operating system can avoid the need for polling or busy waiting, which can waste CPU cycles and reduce system performance.

Interrupts are typically classified as either hardware interrupts or software interrupts. Hardware interrupts are generated by external hardware devices such as keyboard, mouse, network card, and disk drives. Software interrupts, also known as software traps or exceptions, are generated by the operating system or programs in response to specific events or conditions, such as a [[system call]] or a divide-by-zero error.

In summary, interrupts are a fundamental concept in computer systems that enable devices and software to signal the operating system that they need attention or require immediate processing. Interrupts are critical to the efficient and responsive operation of computer systems, and they play a key role in managing system resources and ensuring the stability and reliability of the operating system.
