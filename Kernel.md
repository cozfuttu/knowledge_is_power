A kernel is the core component of an operating system that manages system resources and provides a layer of abstraction between the hardware and software.

The kernel is responsible for providing low-level services such as memory management, [[process]] management, device management, and system calls. It controls access to hardware resources such as the CPU, memory, and I/O devices, and provides a standardized interface for applications to interact with the underlying hardware.

The kernel is the first program that runs when a computer is turned on and is loaded into memory. Once the kernel is loaded, it initializes the system hardware and starts the operating system services. It then creates [[process]]es and threads, allocates memory, and manages the execution of software programs.

The design of a kernel can vary depending on the specific operating system and the hardware architecture it supports. Some operating systems, such as Linux and macOS, use a monolithic kernel, which means that all the kernel functions are contained in a single executable file. Other operating systems, such as Windows and some versions of UNIX, use a microkernel architecture, which separates the kernel functions into separate modules that can be loaded and unloaded dynamically.

The kernel is a critical component of an operating system and is responsible for ensuring the stability, security, and performance of the system. As such, it is typically protected by security mechanisms and is not directly accessible to user-level programs.
