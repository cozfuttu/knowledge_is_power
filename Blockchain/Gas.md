**Gas** in the context of [[blockchain]], specifically Ethereum and similar platforms, is a unit that measures the computational effort required to execute operations, such as executing smart contracts, processing transactions, or interacting with dApps.

### Why Gas Exists

Gas is a mechanism to:

1. **Compensate Miners/[[Validator|Validators]]**:
    - Miners (Proof of Work) or validators (Proof of Stake) receive gas fees as an incentive to process and validate transactions.
2. **Prevent Abuse**:
    - Gas prevents spamming the network by making computationally expensive operations costly.
3. **Prioritize Transactions**:
    - Users can pay higher gas fees to have their transactions processed faster.

### Key Components of Gas

1. **Gas Limit**:
    
    - The maximum amount of gas a user is willing to spend on a transaction.
    - For example, sending ETH requires less gas than deploying a complex smart contract.
2. **Gas Price**:
    
    - The amount of Ether (ETH) a user is willing to pay per unit of gas.
    - Measured in **gwei**, where 1 gwei = 10^-9 ETH.
    - Higher gas prices prioritize your transaction during network congestion.
3. **Total Gas Fee**:
    
    - Calculated as: Total Gas Fee=Gas Used×Gas Price
4. **Base Fee and Tip** (Post-EIP-1559):
    
    - **Base Fee**: Minimum fee set by the network, dynamically adjusted based on congestion.
    - **Tip**: Optional extra fee added by users to incentivize miners/validators for faster processing.

### Example

If you want to send 1 ETH and set:

- Gas Limit = 21,000 (standard for ETH transfer)
- Gas Price = 10 gwei

Then the transaction fee is:

21,000×10 gwei=210,000 gwei=0.00021 ETH

### Gas and Smart Contracts

- Simple transactions (e.g., sending ETH): Require less gas (~21,000 units).
- Complex operations (e.g., interacting with DeFi protocols): Require more gas due to the computational complexity.

### Gas Efficiency

Gas efficiency is critical for reducing transaction costs. Developers aim to write optimized smart contracts to minimize gas usage by:

1. Reducing storage operations (e.g., `SSTORE`).
2. Avoiding unnecessary computation.
3. Using efficient data structures.

### Gas in Other Blockchains

Other blockchains like **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**, **Polygon**, and **Avalanche** use gas concepts, though fees and mechanisms may vary. On networks like **Solana** or **Algorand**, gas is referred to as transaction fees but operates under similar principles.

Gas ensures fair use of network resources and sustains blockchain operations in a decentralized and efficient manner.
