Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a [[Cryptography||cryptographic]] technique that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a specific piece of information, or that a statement is true, without revealing the underlying information itself.

### Key Properties of ZKP:

1. **Completeness**: If the statement is true, an honest prover can convince an honest verifier of its truth.
2. **Soundness**: If the statement is false, no dishonest prover can convince the verifier that it is true, except with some negligible probability.
3. **Zero-Knowledge**: The verifier learns nothing about the information itself other than the fact that the statement is true.

### Types of Zero-Knowledge Proofs:

1. **Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs**:
    
    - The prover and verifier exchange a series of messages.
    - The verifier can challenge the prover to verify their claim.
2. **Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (NIZK)**:
    
    - The prover generates a proof that can be verified without interaction with the prover.
    - Widely used in blockchain systems for efficiency.

### Applications of ZKP:

1. **[[Blockchain]] and Cryptocurrencies**:
    
    - Enhancing privacy in transactions (e.g., Zcash uses zk-SNARKs).
    - Scaling solutions like zk-rollups in Ethereum for efficient data handling.
2. **Authentication**:
    
    - Prove identity without revealing passwords or sensitive data.
3. **Confidential Data Sharing**:
    
    - Prove properties of data (e.g., age, credit score) without exposing the actual data.
4. **Voting Systems**:
    
    - Ensuring votes are valid without revealing voter identities or choices.
5. **Supply Chain**:
    
    - Verify compliance or authenticity of goods without exposing sensitive details.

### Popular ZKP Techniques:

1. **zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge)**:
    
    - Compact, efficient proofs for blockchain applications.
    - Used in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Zcash.
2. **zk-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge)**:
    
    - A scalable and transparent alternative to zk-SNARKs.
    - Does not require a trusted setup.
3. **Bulletproofs**:
    
    - Compact zero-knowledge proofs optimized for range proofs.
    - Used in privacy-preserving cryptocurrency protocols.
