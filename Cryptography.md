**Symmetric Cryptography:**

1. **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):** This is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. It is widely used across the globe for encrypting sensitive data. AES has block sizes of 128 bits and supports keys of sizes 128, 192, and 256 bits.
    
2. **Data Encryption Standard (DES):** DES is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data. Although its key size of 56 bits is now considered too small, it was highly influential in the advancement of modern cryptography.
    
3. **Triple DES (3DES):** This is a symmetric-key block cipher, which applies the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher algorithm three times to each data block. It was designed to provide a relatively simple method of increasing the key size of DES to protect against brute force attacks, without needing to design a completely new block cipher algorithm.
    
4. **Blowfish:** Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher that provides a good encryption rate in software and was designed as a general-purpose encryption algorithm, intended as a replacement for the aging DES.
    
5. **Twofish:** This is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key sizes up to 256 bits. It was one of the five finalists of the Advanced Encryption Standard contest.
    

**Asymmetric Cryptography:**

1. **[[RSA Cryptography|RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)]]:** RSA is one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key which is kept secret (private).
    
2. **Diffie-Hellman key exchange:** This is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel and was one of the first public-key protocols as conceived by Ralph Merkle.
    
3. **[[Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)]]:** ECC is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. Compared to non-ECC cryptography (with the exception of RSA), it provides a higher level of security with shorter key lengths.
    
4. **Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA):** The DSA algorithm involves a public key and a private key. The public key is used to verify signatures, while the private key is used to generate them. It's an algorithm used for digital signatures.
    
5. **ElGamal:** This is a public key cipher - an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography which is based on the Diffie-Hellman key agreement. ElGamal is the predecessor of DSA.
