An opcode (operation code) is a code that specifies a particular machine instruction that the CPU can execute. Each instruction in a computer's machine language has a unique opcode that identifies the operation to be performed.

In [[Assembly]] language programming, opcodes are used to represent the instructions that are executed by the CPU. Each [[Assembly]] language instruction corresponds to a specific opcode that the CPU can understand and execute.

For example, in the x86 [[Assembly]] language, the opcode `mov`  is used to copy data from one location to another. The opcode is followed by operands that specify the source and destination of the data. Here's an example:

`mov eax, ebx`

This instruction copies the contents of the `ebx` register into the `eax` register. The opcode `mov` tells the CPU to perform the move operation, and the operands `eax` and `ebx` specify the source and destination of the data.

In higher-level programming languages, opcodes are typically hidden from the programmer and are generated by the [[compiler]] or [[interpreter]]. The programmer writes code in a more abstract language, and the [[compiler]] or [[interpreter]] generates the corresponding opcodes that the CPU can execute.
