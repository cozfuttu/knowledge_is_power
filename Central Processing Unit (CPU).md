A **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** is the primary component of a computer responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. It is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer because it handles all the essential processing tasks required to run software and manage hardware resources.

### Key Functions of a CPU

1. **Instruction Fetching**:
    
    - Retrieves instructions from memory.
2. **Instruction Decoding**:
    
    - Interprets the instructions and determines the required operations.
3. **Execution**:
    
    - Performs operations such as arithmetic, logic, data movement, or control tasks.
4. **Data Storage**:
    
    - Temporarily stores intermediate results in registers and interacts with memory for data.

### Components of a CPU

1. **Control Unit (CU)**:
    
    - Directs the flow of data between the CPU, memory, and peripherals.
    - Decodes instructions and orchestrates their execution.
2. **[[Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)]]**:
    
    - Performs arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) and logical operations (e.g., AND, OR, NOT).
3. **Registers**:
    
    - Small, fast storage locations within the CPU used to hold data and instructions temporarily.
4. **Cache**:
    
    - A small amount of high-speed memory within or near the CPU that stores frequently accessed data to speed up processing.
5. **Clock**:
    
    - Synchronizes the operations of the CPU by providing a timing signal, measured in Hertz (Hz).

### CPU Performance Metrics

1. **Clock Speed**:
    
    - Measured in GHz (Gigahertz), it indicates how many cycles the CPU can perform per second.
2. **Core Count**:
    
    - Modern CPUs have multiple cores, enabling them to handle multiple tasks simultaneously (e.g., dual-core, quad-core).
3. **Threads**:
    
    - Virtual cores created using technologies like Hyper-Threading, allowing better multitasking.
4. **Cache Size**:
    
    - Affects the CPUâ€™s ability to quickly access data.
5. **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**:
    
    - Defines the commands a CPU can execute (e.g., x86, ARM).

### Types of CPUs

1. **Desktop/Server CPUs**:
    
    - Designed for high performance and multitasking.
    - Example: Intel Core, AMD Ryzen, Xeon processors.
2. **Mobile CPUs**:
    
    - Optimized for power efficiency and performance in mobile devices.
    - Example: Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple A-series chips.
3. **Embedded CPUs**:
    
    - Found in specific-purpose devices like cars, appliances, and IoT devices.
4. **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**:
    
    - Specialized for parallel processing, often used alongside CPUs for tasks like gaming, AI, and video editing.
