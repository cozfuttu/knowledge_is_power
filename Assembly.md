Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is used to write instructions for a computer's CPU. In assembly language, each instruction corresponds to a specific machine language instruction that the CPU can execute directly.

Assembly language is sometimes called "assembly code" or "asm" for short. It is typically used for system-level programming, such as operating system [[kernel]]s, device drivers, and embedded systems, where direct control of the hardware is necessary.

Assembly language is much closer to the machine code that the CPU understands than higher-level programming languages like C or Java. Assembly language programs are usually more concise and run faster than equivalent programs written in higher-level languages, but they can also be more difficult to write and maintain.

Assembly language programs are typically written using a text editor and then assembled into machine code using an assembler program. The resulting machine code can then be loaded into memory and executed directly by the CPU.
