A linker is a tool that combines one or more object files generated by a compiler into a single executable program. When a program is compiled, especially in languages like C or C++, the [[compiler]] converts the source code into object code, which is machine-readable code, but not yet a complete program that can be executed by the operating system. The linker plays a crucial role in this final step of program creation. Here's how it works:

1. **Combining Object Files**: A program can consist of multiple source code files, each compiled into separate object files. The linker combines these object files into a single executable file.
    
2. **Resolving References**: Programs often contain references to variables and functions in other files or libraries. The linker resolves these references, meaning it finds the correct addresses of these variables and functions and updates the references to point to the correct locations.
    
3. **Linking Libraries**: Many programs use libraries, which are collections of pre-compiled code that perform common tasks. The linker connects the program with the libraries it uses, which can be either static or dynamic:
    
    - **Static Libraries**: Incorporated into the final executable, leading to larger file sizes but no external dependencies.
    - **Dynamic Libraries (Shared Libraries)**: Not included in the executable. Instead, the program references the library, which is loaded into memory at runtime. This approach saves space and allows multiple programs to share the same library code.
4. **Address Binding**: The linker assigns final memory addresses to the program's data and instructions. It may involve absolute or relocatable addressing, depending on the operating system and the nature of the program.
    
5. **Error Checking**: The linker can also perform error checks, ensuring that all necessary code and resources are present and correctly referenced.
    

The output of the linking process is an executable file that can be run on the target operating system. This file contains machine code, data, and information needed by the OS to load and run the program.

Linking can be either:

- **Static Linking**: All necessary code is included in the final executable.
- **Dynamic Linking**: The executable contains references to external libraries.

Linkers are a crucial part of the software development process, especially in languages like C, C++, and Fortran, where separate compilation and linking are distinct steps.
