Process forking is a technique used in operating systems to create a new [[process]] by duplicating an existing [[process]]. When a [[process]] forks, a copy of the original [[process]] is created, including all of its code, data, and resources. The new [[process]] is called the "child" process, and the original process is called the "parent" process.

The child process is an exact copy of the parent process, except for its process ID (PID) number, which is different. The child process starts executing at the point where the fork [[system call]] was made, whereas the parent process continues executing after the fork [[system call]].

The fork [[system call]] is often used to create a new [[process]] that will perform a different task than the parent process. For example, a web server may use fork to create a new [[process]] to handle each incoming connection, allowing the server to handle multiple requests simultaneously.

After the fork [[system call]] is made, the child process can modify its own memory space and resources independently of the parent process. However, changes made by the child process do not affect the parent process, and vice versa.

In C programming language, you can fork a process using the `fork()` system call. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to fork a process:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid;
    pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        // child process
        printf("Child process running\n");
        // execute some code in the child process
    } else if (pid > 0) {
        // parent process
        printf("Parent process running\n");
        // execute some code in the parent process
    } else {
        // error occurred
        printf("Fork failed\n");
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, the `fork()` [[system call]] creates a new child process that is an exact copy of the parent process. The `pid` variable is used to store the return value of `fork()`, which is the process ID of the child process if the current process is the parent process, or 0 if the current process is the child process. If `fork()` fails, it returns -1.

Once the new process is created, the code in the child process executes independently of the code in the parent process. The child process starts executing at the point where `fork()` was called, while the parent process continues executing after the `fork()` system call.

By using the `if` and `else` statements, the code can distinguish between the parent process and the child process, and execute different code in each process.

Process forking is a powerful technique that allows developers to create complex systems by dividing tasks among multiple [[process]]es. It is widely used in modern operating systems, and is a fundamental concept in concurrent programming.
