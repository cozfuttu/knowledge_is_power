Public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, is a [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] system that uses pairs of keys: public keys (which may be disseminated widely) and private keys (which are known only to the owner). The generation of such keys depends on cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems to produce one-way functions.

Here's a simple breakdown of how it works:

1. **Key Generation**: Each user generates a pair of cryptographic keys - a public key and a private key. The public key is made available to anyone who wants to communicate securely with the user. The private key is kept secret and only known to the user.
    
2. **Encryption**: If Alice wants to send a secure message to Bob, she uses Bob's public key to encrypt the message. The encrypted message can only be decrypted with Bob's private key.
    
3. **Decryption**: Upon receiving the encrypted message, Bob uses his private key to decrypt it.
    
4. **Signature**: Additionally, if Alice wants to send a message that can be verified as coming from her, she can use her private key to create a digital signature on the message. Bob (or anyone else) can use Alice's public key to verify the signature.
    

Public key cryptography forms the basis of many important information security technologies, including HTTPS (for secure web browsing), SSH (for secure remote logins), PGP/GPG (for secure email), and many more. The RSA algorithm and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) are popular methods for public key cryptography.

The main advantage of public key cryptography is the increased security it provides. Because the private key is never shared, it's extremely difficult for a malicious actor to obtain it. This is in contrast to symmetric cryptography, where the key used to encrypt and decrypt the message is the same and must somehow be securely shared between the two parties.
