A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads of the computer's CPU. A process represents a single task that a computer system can perform, such as running a word processor, playing a video game, or downloading a file from the internet.

Each process has its own memory space, which is separate from the memory space of other processes. This means that the memory used by one process cannot be accessed or modified by another process, unless a special mechanism like [[inter-process communication (IPC)]] is used. The memory space is divided into sections, including the code section (which contains the program's executable code), the data section (which contains the program's data), and the stack section (which contains the program's call stack).

Processes are managed by the operating system, which provides various services to ensure that each process is able to execute correctly and efficiently. These services include memory management, scheduling, process synchronization, and input/output operations.

No two processes can have the same process id (PID) at the same time. When a process is started, the operating system assigns a new unique PID to the process. Once the process has completed its execution, the operating system frees the PID and it becomes available for reuse by a new process.

A process in an operating system can have several states depending on its current activity and its interaction with the system. The exact number of states can vary depending on the specific operating system, but in general, a process can have the following states:

1.  New: The process has just been created and has not yet been admitted to the system.
    
2.  Ready: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor for execution.
    
3.  Running: The process is currently being executed by a processor.
    
4.  Blocked: The process is unable to run because it is waiting for a resource to become available, such as user input, data from disk, or completion of an I/O operation.
    
5.  Terminated: The process has completed its execution and has been removed from the system.
    
6.  Suspended: The process is temporarily removed from memory and placed onto disk, but can be resumed at a later time.
    
7.  [[Zombie Process|Zombie]]: The process has completed its execution but has not yet been removed from the system because its parent process has not yet called the wait() [[system call]] to retrieve its exit status.

These states allow the operating system to manage the execution of processes efficiently and ensure that system resources are used effectively. The operating system uses various scheduling algorithms to determine when to move a process from one state to another, and to allocate resources such as memory, CPU time, and I/O bandwidth to the processes that need them.

The concept of processes is central to the way modern operating systems work. By allowing multiple processes to run concurrently on a single system, operating systems are able to provide users with the ability to run multiple programs at the same time, as well as to manage system resources efficiently.
